Hello.
This is a class 12 cbse boards project : INSTITUE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
I created this so as to submit for my practical and then uploaded it here ...
Concepts used are mainly file manipulation , defining functions & database manipulation.
Ad.py       ->File in which functions for admission are defined.Deatils such as Admission ID,Name,age,DOB,BldGrp,Adress are included and written in its created table in database.
St.py       ->File in which functions for class are defined.Deatils such as Roll No,Name,Stream,Percentage are included and written in its created table in database.
fe.py       ->File in which functions for payment of fees are defined.Deatils about fee status(PAID or UNPAiD, AMOUNT LEFT if some is unpaid) is included and written in its created table in database.
Menu.py     ->A file which contains all menus used in program in trple qouted strings in diffrent variables and are avaiable for direct use after importing this file.
Commands.txt->A file which contains commands and data to be used to create a first run basic database and tables.
Conn.py     ->a file which contains functions defined to :
                        a)connect to the SQL database with host,username passwd and databse name.
                        b)create the database required with commands and data from commands.txt.
                        c)create a tabular display of data.
Main.py     ->A file where all the above files are imported and the main executable program is written.
The definations used in ad,st,fe are pretty similar and easy to understand I think...ðŸ˜œ


CAUTION:All the files are to be stored in the same folder and the file to be run(i.e. the executable one) is MAIN.py.
